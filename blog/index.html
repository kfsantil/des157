     <h2>BLOG 1: SPOTIFY</h2>

    <p>

An interface that I use on a daily-basis is Spotify. Spotify’s interface design is unique and very distinct. Spotify is a music playing app that allows users to listen to all types of genres and artists. In terms of visual design Spotify has a sleek and well organized interface. The design is very consistent with all playlists with its signature green color. Its effective in browsing the selection of different songs. It keeps your playlists on the sidebar as well as a list of recommended music based on your searches and frequently listened song. The interface is frequently updated with new releases of music every week. The overview page is well designed with icons linked to music playlists based on the type of mood you’re looking for. This music sharing app also has a friend’s activity bar that allows other Spotify users to share their playlists to the public. Overall, Spotify’s interface is easy to use and speaks to everyone of all ages with its design and music variety.
